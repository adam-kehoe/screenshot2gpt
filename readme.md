# Screenshot2GPT

This is a small hacky experiment to create a simple screenshot utility that can send its output to OpenAI vision models for common tasks.

The idea is to explore modestly scoped AI tools as quick keyboard shortcuts that live in the daily OS, not just deliberative conversation partners that require opening purpose-built applications.

Uses so far:

+ Generating quick UI/UX critiques for prototyping
+ Explaining complex academic language in simpler terms
+ Generating plausible prompts from images
+ Identifying components in electronics projects
